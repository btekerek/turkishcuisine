            <h2> Main Dishes in Turkish Cuisine </h2>
            <p>Turkey may be famous for its kebabs, but the popular dish is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
                Turkish cuisine.
                Covering over 300,000 square miles, the European destination's rich and diverse food is largely thanks
                to its landscape.
                Plateaus and plains of fertile soil formed by now extinct volcanoes, snow-covered mountains and
                fast-flowing rivers lend themselves to a rich and varied table.
                This includes olive oil based dishes from the Mediterranean Coast, hearty pastries from central
                Anatolia, subtle spicy flavors from the east and southeast, and that's just for starters.
                Traditional Turkish foods rely less on seasonings and more on tasty fresh ingredients rolled, kneaded,
                shaped and cooked to perfection with care, dedication and passion.
                Here are some recipes you can try at home:

            <h3>Ezogelin Soup</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>
                According to legend, this dish was dreamed up by an unhappily married woman named Ezo who was trying to
                win over her mother-in-law via her stomach.
                She concocted a zesty soup consisting of red lentils, domato salca (tomato paste -- sweet or hot),
                grated fresh tomatoes and onions, served with dried mint and pul biber (chili flakes) sprinkled on top.
                There's no proof it actually worked, but just in case, ezogelin (which literally translates to bride
                Ezo), originating from a small village near Gaziantep, is still the food of choice for brides-to-be.

            <h3>Yaprak Sarma</h3>

                <img src="img/sarma.jpg" alt="Boiled vine leaves stuffed and rolled with rice and spices">
            </figure>
            <p>In the Isparta (a southern city) version of yaprak sarma, rice is cooked with tomatoes, a bunch of
                parsley, onion, garlic, tomato paste, olive oil, black pepper, salt and water.
                A spoonful of this mixture is placed on a vine leaf, folded in and carefully rolled by hand into neat
                little cylinders.
                While leaves are sold at most street markets, the best ones come from a neighbor's tree, usually picked
                at midnight.
                Yaprak sarma are part of Turkish Aegean cuisine and sometimes include a pinch of cinnamon in the mix, a
                nod to the Rum people, Greeks born in Turkey.

            <h3>Iskender Kebap</h3>

            <p>Located in northwest Turkey, Bursa is famous for three things -- silk, the ski fields of Uludag and a
                type of kebab called Iskender.
                Apparently a gentleman of the same name first cooked this dish for workers in the city's Kayhan Bazaar
                back in 1867.
                Thin slices of doner meat are reverently laid over pieces of plump pide bread, smothered in freshly made
                tomato sauce, baptized with a dash of sizzling melted butter and served with a portion of tangy yoghurt,
                grilled tomato and green peppers.
