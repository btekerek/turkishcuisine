            <h2>About Turkish Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                Turkish cuisine comprises a wide variety of foods, with pastries
                taking the first place. Bread is the core food ingredient. A variety
                of kebabs and some meat dishes, including the juicy types such as
                yahni (stew), are available. Without water, onion, ground beef, meat,
                tomato, and vegetables are added to foods after being roasted in oil.
                Vegetables are consumed as raw salad. Onion and tomato paste are the
                primary ingredients for all Turkish dishes. Oil is given great
                importance in the Turkish cuisine. Lard, butter fat, or butter is used
                in meat dishes, pastries, and meaty or meatless vegetable dishes.
                Olive oil is used in vegetable dishes based on necessity and condition
                but is mainly used in pans. Turkish cuisine is among the richest
                cuisines in the world and will greatly contribute to branding of
                destinations with correct positioning and creation of attractive
                image. Turkish cuisine is among the few popular cuisines in the world
                and is one of the three main cuisines besides Chinese and French
                cuisines. Let’s take a look at this video:

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                Undoubtedly, the richness of the Turkish culture is due to the old
                history of Turks, and furthermore, Turks have migrated in huge numbers
                from past until today. Thus, Turks own a rich culinary culture
                synthesized as a consequence of migration to different geographical
                areas and interaction with different cultures. There is a very close
                connection between the food and nutrition culture and gastronomic
                values of each nation. Gastronomy is a branch of science studying
                aesthetics in eating and drinking as well as seeking beauty and
                quality. Gastronomy experts refer to Turkish cuisine as one of the
                world's major cuisines. When we observe the relation between
                gastronomy and Turkish cuisine, it could be understood that the roots
                of Turkish cuisine date back to the Central Asian Turks. The
                gastronomic richness of different regions was added to Turkish cuisine
                in the later periods, in parallel with geographic expansion of the
                Ottoman Empire. This compilation has been done by analyzing studies on
                culinary culture and gastronomic values throughout Turkish history.
                Although Turkish cuisine history can be analyzed in many different
                eras (before Islam, Seljuk period, Ottoman Empire etc.) we will take a
                closer look to the effect of Western food on Turkish cuisine in modern
                Turkey.

            <h2>Today's Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                In today's Turkey, food culture varies from region to region. Eastern
                Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia, Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean, and
                Mediterranean regions have their own food cultures. In the Black Sea
                region, we can give a few examples representing the food wealth. For
                example, over 20 dishes are made from the known mixture of corn.
                Dishes made from anchovies such as stuffed fried anchovies, anchovy
                bread, anchovies rice, anchovies pan and meatballs, anchovies boiled,
                anchovies grill, and anchovy patty show how rich the Black Sea cuisine
                is. Vegetable and olive oil–based dishes are common in Mediterranean
                cuisine, specifically in the Mediterranean regions of Turkey. Olives
                have been used in Mediterranean cuisine for 2500 years. After olive
                oil, the most important factor shaping the Aegean cuisine is herbs
                available in the region. Countless types of herbs exist therein. In
                case we count the main herbs used in Izmir, we get a long list: vine,
                hibiscus, nettle, arugula, parsley, radish sprouts, thistle, chicory,
                poppy, dock, Kushto of plantain, blessed thistle, dandelion, Helvajik,
                asparagus, tangle, samphire, etc. These herbs are more consumed in
                Izmir and the entire Aegean coast. In addition, there are many types
                of herbs that are edible and grown in nature and are very important
                for their economic and cultural value in Turkey. These herb salads are
                commonly consumed in season. These wild herbs grow in spring and
                contribute to human nutrition.
