            <h2>Desserts</h2>
            <p>
                Turkish desserts are here to entice your palate and satisfy your sweet cravings. The Turks have a fine
                way of making irresistible sweet dishes!
                They fall into three types: milk-based, pastry-based, and those made with fruits or vegetables.
                Using unusual ingredients like chicken breast is also expected in this cuisine.
                So, beyond the ever-popular baklava, there are so many desserts from Turkey that are worth trying out.
                If you’re thinking of making them at home, lucky you
                This website rated best Turkish desserts, no doubt that it is highly subjective:

            <h3>Rice Pudding</h3>
            <p>Made with heavy cream, short-grain rice, and milk, this rice pudding is light, easy to eat, and not
                overly sweet.
                In short, it’s the perfect dessert to have any time of the day!
                This pudding mixture is cooked on the stove and then transferred to oven-safe bowls for baking.
                You’ll know it’s done when the top is slightly burned, so it’ll look pretty close to creme brulee.
                The pudding’s caramel-y taste is already heavenly, but you can take it up a notch by sprinkling ground
                cinnamon on top!
            </p>

            <h3>Noah’s Ark Pudding (Asure)</h3>


            <p>Ashure, or Noah’s Ark pudding, is served in Turkey all year round, but it’s most popular during Muharram,
                the Islamic calendar’s first month.
                Anecdotal history has it that this dessert originated from the pudding made by Noah himself.
                After the waters from the great flood had receded, Noah made a pudding using everything that was left on
                the ark, mainly dried fruits, nuts, and grains.
                As such, the recipe for this dessert isn’t set in stone. The classic pudding uses rose water for
                flavoring. For a citrusy kick, you can use orange and lemon zest instead.

            <h3>Turkish Churros</h3>
            <p>Churros are a popular snack, not just in Turkey but also in other countries like Spain, France, and the
                Philippines.
                Turkish churros have the same dough and cooking method as tulumba, which is probably why they look
                pretty similar.
                This recipe yields crunchy and golden churros tossed in cold sweet syrup.
                They’re a famous street food in Turkey, but you can bring their authentic taste to your home in 30
                minutes.
                Like other variations of churros, you can amplify the flavor of the Turkish version by adding a sweet
                filling. Dipping them into melted chocolate is a fun idea, too!
            </p>
